# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML

Project Overview:
In this project, I applpied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 
After exploring the data to learn how the census data is recorded, applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. 
Then evaluating several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. 
Afterwards, Optimized the model I've selected and present it as my solution to CharityML. 
Finally, I've explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
